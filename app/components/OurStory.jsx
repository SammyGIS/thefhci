            This initiative began in 2011 with a simple mission: to provide
            medical and healthcare services to communities and individuals in
            need. What started as a passionate initiative to address health
            challenges quickly grew into a movement driven by the desire to
            create lasting impact and transform lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, recognizing the need for a more formal structure to scale
            its impact effectively, the initiative transitioned into a
            registered Non-Governmental and Non-Profit Organization. This
            formalization allowed The FHCI to strengthen its operations, expand
            its reach, and solidify its role as a key player in community health
            and development.

          The Famkris Healthcare Initiative was founded by Pharmacist Christian
          O. Onuh, with a vision to address the healthcare challenges faced by
          Africa's rural and underserved communities. Inspired by the belief
          that everyone deserves quality healthcare services, we aim to bridge
          this gap.
